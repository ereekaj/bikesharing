# Citi Bike Bikesharing Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
My friend Kate, and I want to open up a bike share business in Des Moines, IA.  Citi Bike in New York City shares it's rider data with the public. The purpose of this analysis is to analyze the Citi Bike data using Tableau and create visualizations to show insights to potential investors in the Des Moines market. 

## Results: 
Here is a link to my [tableau dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/Challenge14_16479124062720/CitiBikeStory?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) with specific visualizations pictured below.

This first chart from the module work shows the average trip duration by birth date of the bike user.  Despite a few outliers in the earlier birth dates, from this chart it appears that as the birth date increases or as the age of the user decreases, the average trip duration increases.

The two charts above plot checkout time by users. The second chart breaks down the users by gendor.  It is clear from both charts that users check out bikes for about 5 to 20 minutes for the first hour.  In the second chart, it shows that there are many more male customers than female customers but they both check out bikes for about the same time.

The heatmap above shows the trips by weekday per hour.  It is clear from the chart that during the week, bikes are used most often during rush hour commute times in the morning from about 7 am - 9 am and again in the afternoon from about 5 pm - 7 pm. On the weekend days, bikes are mostly used between the hours of 10 am and 5 pm.  

![image of peak hours chart](https://github.com/ereekaj/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/peak_hours.png)

The next bar chart from my module work confirms the finding from the previous heatmap showing the peak hours of use of bikes in August.  The peak hours in morning are from 7 am - 9 am and the peak hours in the afternoon are from 5 pm - 7 pm. 

![image for heatmap of trips per gender per weekday and hour](https://github.com/ereekaj/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/trips_gender_weekday_hour.png)

The heatmap above shows trips by weekday per hour and also breaks it down by gender.  The peak hours are the same for both genders but the charts shows that males use the bikes more during those hours by the darker colors on the map.

The last heatmap breaks down user trips by gender, type of user by weekday.  It is clear that subscribers overall use the bikes more often than customers and that male subscribers use the bikes more than female counterparts. 

## Summary: 

From the visualizations above we've determined that younger users use the bikes more, male users use the bikes more. Also bikes are used most often during rush hour commute times in the morning from about 7 am - 9 am and again in the afternoon from about 5 pm - 7 pm. On the weekend days, bikes are mostly used between the hours of 10 am and 5 pm.  

To see how these results may translate to the Des Moines market, I suggest getting demographic data of both cities from somewhere like census.gov or data.gov. Visualizations could be used to compare the NYC population by age and by gender compared to Citi Bike users by age and gender.  Then compare how the Des Moines population stacks up the NYC to get an idea of how many customers we could expect.
